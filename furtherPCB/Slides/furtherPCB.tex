\frametitle{FPGA Workshop?}
My proposal is:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Two workshops
	\begin{itemize}
		\item WTFpga - Implementing a 7 segment decoder at your own pace
		\item LED Matrix / UART / Simulation / FPGA Theory
		\item Verilog only (no SystemVerilog / VHDL)
	\end{itemize}
	\item Requires Linux / Mac, may work on windows.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Will provide untested instruction for windows which may require different workflow - pull requests welcomed 
	\end{itemize}
	\item FPGA hardware will be \$50
	\begin{itemize}
		\item iCE-40 FPGA in feather form factor
		\item 7 Segment / DIP switch board
		\item 6*6 LED Matrix / Buttons
		\item Feather to dual PMOD (bare PCB)
		\item Want to assemble your own? Can be organised!
	\end{itemize}
	\item Will get hardware to everyone before next meetup, so you can install toolchains / get to blinky at your own leisure 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Multilayer PCBs
	\item Impedance control
	\item Differential Pairs
	\item Cutting edge processes
	\item Random KiCad things
	\item Panellisation
	\item Layout Tips

\frametitle{Multilayer PCBs}
PCBs are often 2 or 4 layers, but 8-16 is common for phones / motherboards / GPUs etc. Why?
\begin{itemize}
	\item Dedicated power / ground planes
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Allows for low impedance supply and return of currents
			\item Not only required for function of devices, but to pass emissions testing
			\item Many different ways to design multilayer boards, will be shown later
		\end{itemize}
	\item More layers to route signals
	\item Required for BGA fanout
	\item Impedance control
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\frametitle{Impedance Controlled Traces}
What is impedance?\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item the effective resistance of an electric circuit or component to alternating current, arising from the combined effects of ohmic resistance and reactance
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{impedance.png}
\end{figure}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Impedance Controlled Traces}
Why do we care?\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item Impedance mismatch results in reflections, which causes power loss and signal degradation 
	\item Mismatches caused by incorrect track width, stubs, lack of termination resistors 
\end{itemize}
\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{reflections.png}

Characteristic Impedance
$$ Z_0 = \sqrt{\frac{L}{C}} $$

PCB transmission line\\
\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{microstrip.jpg}
\end{figure}
To calculate, use tools such as TXLine or Saturn PCB Toolkit\\
\vspace{2mm}
At higher frequencies, (> 2GHz) FR4's dialectic constant changes + has high loss\\
Materials such as PTFE, Rogers (glass reinforced hydrocarbon/ceramics) are better suited to higher frequency applications \\
Packing and orientation of glass weave can also play a part 
\end{frame}

\frametitle{Impedance Controlled Traces}
I'm designing a digital board, so I don't have to worry about this?\\
\begin{columns}

	\begin{figure}
		\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{squareFFT.png}
	\end{figure}

	\column{.49\textwidth}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Bandwidth = $\frac{0.34}{t_{rise}}$
		\item Dependent on rise / fall times, not frequency (although higher frequencies do require faster edges)
	\end{itemize}
\end{columns}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Impedance Controlled Traces}
Return current?\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item Impedance controlled traces must be referenced to an unbroken plane (can be ground or power)
	\item As return current takes path of least impedance, follows path of outbound current!
	\item Slots, gaps, cut outs all result in return current taking a long path and emitting EMI
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Impedance Controlled Traces}
Confirming correct Impedance?\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item Follow fabricators guidelines NOT TXLine etc tools - they know their process best
	\item Board houses do what is known as 'Etch Compensation' to ensure traces stay at required impedance
	\item They can also make a test coupon, and measure with a TDR to ensure correct dimensions
\end{itemize}
