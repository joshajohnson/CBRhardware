# furtherPCB

A workshop delving into more detail about PCB design, including 4+ layer stack ups, impedance controlled traces and boards, layout tips, and looking at what the modern state of the art is in PCB manufacturing and assembly.

We will also discuss tools and how to use them to achieve the above mentioned design considerations, followed by looking at some of Josh's projects and identifying where these techniques have been utilised.

Hope to see everyone there!
