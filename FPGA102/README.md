# FPGA102
Project files for a continuation of the WTFpga workshop.  

### Folder Structure
`gateware` contains projects designed to be run on the iCE40-feather, sometimes with a featherwing attached.

`test-gateware` contains both test projects to show function of device, along with projects to test specific IP core e.g. UART.

These folders have been stolen from the iCE40-feather repo linked below, please direct all pull requests / issues there.
