SPI flash
=========

This contains cores to allow access to the SPI flash normally used for
FPGA configuration and use it for user data.

Currently only a simple flash reader core is implemented allowing to easily
read bytes from the flash at a given address.

These cores are licensed under the BSD 3-clause licence (see LICENSE.bsd)
