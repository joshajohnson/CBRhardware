# Electronic Hardware Design

This talk will cover the process of designing, manufacturing, and assembling electronic hardware, with a focus on how to use KiCad to design and layout a PCB. 
Using a keyboard Josh designed as an example, aspects of the process such as circuit design, PCB layout and assembly, along with programming and mechanical design will be demonstrated, with the goal of providing an overview of the process for anyone interested in designing their own hardware.

**Josh Johnson**

Josh is passionate about electronic design and spends far too much time designing boards and writing firmware. 
He is currently in his final semester of university, and is looking forward to joining the real world next year with a product development role in automotive. 

### Keyboard Design Files
Design files for the keyboard discussed can be found [here](https://github.com/joshajohnson/MacroKeyboard).  
If you are considering assembling the above board, modifying it for your own use, or designing one from scratch, feel free to get in touch as there are some things I would change on that board for a new revision. 

### SAO Design
The `SAO` folder has a partial KiCad project with everything you need to make a SAO for BSides 2020.
The schematic is known good, so all you need to do is make an awesome design and ensure is passes DRC.
A completed design is [also available](https://github.com/joshajohnson/CBRhardware/tree/master/SAO101), along with Josh's 2019 [WarGames SAO](https://github.com/joshajohnson/WarGames_SAO).
### Questions? 
Feel free to get in touch with any questions.  
No guarantees I'll be able to help, but will try my best!
