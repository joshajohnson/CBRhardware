# breadboard2pcboard

Prototyped a circuit on a breadboard, and want to get it onto a printed cicruit board but not sure how? If so this talk is for you!  
We will be going over how to to take a bunch of breakout boards with wires flying between them and get it onto a professional looking PCB.  

Hope to see everyone there!
