# Canberra Hardware Meetup
A monthly hardware meetup for anyone interested in electronics / hardware. 

Held on the second Monday of each month, 6-8pm, at [Infosect](https://www.infosectcbr.com.au), 2/9 Beaconsfield Street, Fyshwick, 2609 ACT.  

We'll cover topics such as PCB design / layout, embedded programming, tips and tricks to make hardware less hard, and everything in between.   

All skill levels welcome, and feel free to bring along any projects you are working on or need a hand with as well.  

If you have any suggestions about topics to discuss / changes to make, please get in touch.

## 8/4/19 - Intro to KiCad / How to design a PCB

A workshop going over how to design a printed circuit board in KiCad.  

Aimed at beginners who haven't designed many boards before, or folks who have design experience but haven't used KiCad much.  

Feel free to bring a laptop with [KiCad 5.1](http://kicad-pcb.org/download/) installed if you want to design along, otherwise just come along and ask questions as we go. I would highly suggest bringing a mouse as well, as laying out board with a trackpad is not much fun. 

The [SAO101](/SAO101) folder contains resources which will be used on the night.
